With this address book you can do simple stuff like listing, creating, updating and deleting contacts from the book. It can be done through the command-line interface (CLI), and soon through a graphical user interface (GUI).

All the data is stored in a single .yml file. In the future, it'll be encrypted.

**Disclaimer : this projet isn't really aimed to be used as an every day address book. It's just a small project that I made in order to learn the language and how to write clean code.**

## ‚å® Usage

Before continuing, make sure you have Go 1.12 or earlier installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exybore/go-address-book.git  # HTTP
git clone git@github.com:exybore/go-address-book          # SSH
```

Edit the configuration through the `config.toml` file. Every option and possible choice is explained, and the syntax is very user-friendly.

If you want to quickly test the application, use `go run main.go`. Otherwise, use `go build` to compile into an executable file.
